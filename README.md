# Computer Vision Project

My project uses a Naive Bayes Classifier to recognize handwritten numerical digits written in 28x28 sized ASCII art. I wrote this project as a Python 3 Script and used the Numpy and Matplotlib libraries.

First, the classifier is trained on 5000 handwritten digits. Then, the classifier is tested on 1000 unknown handwritten digits. The classifier performs well with 72% accuracy on the testing set. My project also prints statistical information such as a confusion matrix, likelihood maps, etc. 

###How to run the Program:
1. Install IPython.
2. Open "Computer Vision.ipynb" from IPython
3. Click on the first block of code.
4. Press Shift+Enter to execute the code blocks sequentially.

*Note:* If there are technical difficulties, load "Computer Vision.html" on your Browser. You cannot run the program from here, but you can still see the code.
